Also a nice place to try a new book. Prices are good and there are also different fundraisers. Like once when I went there, they let me purchse a book of my choice that would be donated to the unprivilged kids. Again, must visit soon if you haven't yet!

                    I always feel happy and fresh when I watch tjis movie. It recently came out in 2020. It's about kids saving the world and is not too heroic but fun and humorous too. There are just the right points where the comedy but intresting moments and surprises come out. Great family movie!

                    In an effort to be more environmentally responsible, LEGO have said they aim to stop manufacturing bricks made of plastic resin and are considering other options, which could include hemp. According to Telegraph World, the company makes 60 billion blocks a year. While LEGO want to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have, especially with the effective “clicking” together is a key aspect of the iconic coloured block.

                    LIKE A STORY-BOOK villain, the covid-19 pandemic has a habit of fighting back from the brink of defeat. Last summer politicians were quick to assume that the coronavirus had been squashed, only for a second wave to engulf much of Europe and North America in the autumn. Then, as vaccine programmes got under way in December, new mutations of SARS-CoV-2 emerged that may lower the efficacy of those vaccines. Today a third wave of infections is sweeping through Europe, forcing many governments to impose another round of lockdowns. From midnight on March 19th, 21m people in France will enter a new month-long lockdown, on top of a nationwide curfew that has been in place since January 16th. Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, warned that her country would probably need to apply an “emergency brake” and reimpose a lockdown.

But then the letters start dropping on the doormat at Number Four, Privet Drive. Addressed to “Mr. H. Potter” and stamped shut with a purple wax seal, the peculiar envelopes are swiftly confiscated by his relentlessly cruel family. But nothing stops Rubeus Hagrid, a great beetle-eyed giant of a man, from kicking down the door and bursting in with astonishing news: Harry Potter is a wizard - and not only a wizard, he’s an incredibly famous wizard. Hagrid spirits him away to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, setting into motion an incredible adventure (Banks run by goblins! Enchanted train platforms! Invisibility Cloaks!) that listeners won’t ever forget.<br> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Sorcerers-Stone-Book/dp/B017V4IMVQ/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Harry+potter+book+1&qid=1616719960&sr=8-1"><b>BEST BUY LINK</b></a> </p>
